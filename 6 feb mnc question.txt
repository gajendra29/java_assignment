Q1)
Problem Statement – Chaman planned to choose a four digit lucky number for his car. His
lucky numbers are 3,5 and 7. Help him find the number, whose sum is divisible by 3 or 5 or
7. Provide a valid car number, Fails to provide a valid input then display that number is not a
valid car number.
Note : The input other than 4 digit positive number[includes negative and 0] is considered as
invalid.
Refer the samples, to read and display the data.

Ans)
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Mnc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the number for car");
        int num = sc.nextInt();
        if(num>=1000 && num<=9999){
            int rem;
            int sum = 0;
            while(num>0){
                rem = num%10;
                sum = sum+rem;
                num = num/10;
            }
            if(sum%3==0 || sum%5==0 || sum%7==0){
                System.out.println("This is lucky number");
            }
            else{
                System.out.println("This is not lucky number");
            }
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("Not vaild input");
        }
    }

Q4)
Problem Statement – To speed up his composition of generating unpredictable rhythms,
Blue Bandit wants the list of prime numbers available in a range of numbers.Can you help
him out?
Write a java program to print all prime numbers in the interval [a,b] (a and b, both inclusive).
Note
Input 1 should be lesser than Input 2. Both the inputs should be positive.
Range must always be greater than zero.
If any of the condition mentioned above fails, then display “Provide valid input”
Use a minimum of one for loop and one while loop

5)
Problem Statement – Rhea Pandey’s teacher has asked her to prepare well for the
lesson on seasons. When her teacher tells a month, she needs to say the season
corresponding to that month. Write a program to solve the above task.
Spring – March to May,
Summer – June to August,
Autumn – September to November and,
Winter – December to February.
Month should be in the range 1 to 12. If not the output should be “Invalid month”.

Ans)
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Mnc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Write the month");
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        if(name.equals("march to may")){
            System.out.println("spring");
        }
        else if(name.equals("june to august")){
            System.out.println("summer");
        }
        else if(name.equals("sept to nov")){
            System.out.println("autumn");
        }
        else if(name.equals("dec to feb")){
            System.out.println("winter");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("invalid");
        }
    }
}

7)
Problem Statement – FOE college wants to recognize the department which has
succeeded in getting the maximum number of placements for this academic year.
The departments that have participated in the recruitment drive are CSE,ECE,
MECH. Help the college find the department getting maximum placements. Check
for all the possible output given in the sample snapshot
Note : If any input is negative, the output should be “Input is Invalid”. If all
department has equal number of placements, the output should be “None of the
department has got the highest placement”.

Ans)
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Mnc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the number of placement number in CSE ");
        int cse = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the number of placement number in ECE ");
        int ece = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the number of placement number in MECH ");
        int mech = sc.nextInt();
        if(ece>0 || cse>0 || mech>0){
            if(cse>ece && cse>mech){
                System.out.println("Highest placement cse "+cse);
            }
            else if(ece>cse && ece>mech){
                System.out.println("Highest palcement ece "+ece);
            }
            else if(mech>ece && mech>cse){
                System.out.println("Highest palcement mech "+mech);
            }
            else{
                System.out.println("None of the department has got the highest placement");
            }
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("Input is invalid");
        }
    }
}
